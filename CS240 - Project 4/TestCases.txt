Test Cases:
All:
1. All queues enqueue successfully
2. All queues dequeue correctly
3. Empty queues return null when dequeueing while empty

FIFO Queues:
4. FIFO Queues maintain order when enqueueing and dequeueing multiple items
5. FIFO Queues implemented generically

Priority Queue:
6. Priority Queue dequeues highest priority first
7. Properly handles an assignment with 0 days remaining (due today)
8. Differentiates priority between assignments with value lower than days remaining (int restraints)
